# Software Requirements

* STM32 CUBE IDE
* QEMU

# COMPONENTS
* STM32F4O7VG MICROCONTROLLER BOARD


# Working Principle
Assume that the automobile is the microcontroller. If the button is hit, the first led (red) will turn on, Clicking again  the wiper will start, and the second led (blue) will turn on for a desired rate. If the button is pressed again, the third led (green) will turn on, and the wiper's speed will be increased in comparison to the previous one. The fourth press will turn on the fourth led (orange), and the wiper speed will be increased in accordance with the previous one. The microcontroller (vehicle) is turned off after the fifth click.
