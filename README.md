## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. online resources helped a lot for learning STM32Cube Ide software. 
2. as most of the the functions required different types of functions, geeks for geeks websites helps a lot.
3. while running the multiple files. Make file helped a lot to resolve this.
4. Futureskills Materials also helps in understanding Embedded Systems.
